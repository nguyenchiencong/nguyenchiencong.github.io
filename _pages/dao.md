<hr>

Most translations of the <o>Dao De Jing</o> or Tao Te Ching (<ch>道德經</ch>) today are quite mediocre. A good translation doesn't need too many footnotes or too much poeticization, but should be still understandable. Translators analyze with their personal and limited perspective, to lose the soul of the work. Because in the end, all knowledge is limited, understanding the wisdom of a certain philosophy (<ch>哲學</ch>) will help the translator go beyond the knowledge of words and its language.  

The name <ch>道德經</ch> can be translated as <o>Book of Ethics</o>. Ethics in Western languages date back to ēthike (moral philosophy), which draws its origin from the word ēthos (manners). Meanwhile, in Chinese-related languages, <ch>道德</ch> is composed of <ch>道</ch> [way] and <ch>德</ch> [virtue]. The word <ch>道</ch> itself is composed of <ch>辶</ch> [walking] and <ch>首</ch> [head], and the word <ch>德</ch> has <ch>彳</ch> [small step] and <ch>心</ch> [heart] in it.

This work is said to be composed by [老子](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laozi) [Lao Tzu], divided into 2 main parts: Upper and Lower. With erudite words, 81 chapters go through many topics from how to live to how to govern. The Dao De Jing may have been patched together by many authors, and we do not really know exactly who Lao Tzu was ; it doesn't really matter. Due to many variations, the number of words in the Dao De Jing is still inconsistent:

\* 2 copies of the [Silk Book](https://web.hnmuseum.com/zh-hans/zuixintuijie/%E5%B8%9B%E4%B9%A6%E3%80%8A%E8%80%81% E5%AD%90%E4%B9%99%E6%9C%AC%E3%80%8B) (帛书) written on silk found at Mǎ wáng duī (馬王堆), the first (<ch>甲</ch>) version includes 5342 words, the second (<ch>乙</ch>) version includes 5344 words.  
\* The book《道德經章句》by Hé Shàng Gōng (河上公) has 5201 words.  
\* The book《老子道德經注》by Wáng Bì (王弼) has 5162 words.  
\* The writing on bamboo cards found at Guō diàn (郭店) has over 13,000 words, of which more than 2,000 words are similar to other versions.  

There are many profound parts and some obscure parts, yet not shallow.  

Many passages are somewhat imperative while still trying to be realistic and therefore too abstract for the average reader. It's like saying how to do things without asking why things should be that way. In the end, it is still just a self-projecting approach to reality, not reality itself. Because of the lack of an existential investigation into the nature of thinking and the self. One cannot find order in disorder, one has to look at disorder and understand it first. The main theme of the work is non-action (<ch>無為</ch>), but for non-action to be, it must start from non-self (<ch>無我</ch>). And to be selfless, one has to understand the self beforehand.

The Dao De Jing is a work for rulers because it contains a lot of political thinking. But, there is a fundamental problem here: if one understands wu-wei (<ch>無為</ch>), one cannot become a king. To become kings and lords, one must want, that is, to have desire, and to have desire is to have action (<ch>有為</ch>). Wu-wei only has one way, which is to retreat, not do politics, because politics is fundamentally a passion for power and lust after all. Therefore, those who desire to be kings can't understand the Dao De Jing, and those who understand do not want to be kings.

This is just a simple translation, for fun and mainly to learn Chinese, without any further judgment or analysis. And it also does not promote the following of Taoism.
