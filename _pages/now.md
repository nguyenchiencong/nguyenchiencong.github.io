### Making a video game

Details on the game [here](/game).  

Everything is on its course.  

Things are moving quite fast, from story writing to architectural design to pixel art drawing to programming.  

I’ve recently implemented a quasi-autonomous debugging process with Godot-MCP.
I’ve made it available here if you’re interested: 
- [godot-mcp](https://github.com/nguyenchiencong/godot-mcp)
- [local-docs-mcp](https://github.com/nguyenchiencong/local-docs-mcp)

Handling AI models and coding agents feels like collecting and handling pokemons.  

Health is a bit wobbly with the seasonal change and the current local influenza epidemic going on.

I will update if there's something relevant to share.
