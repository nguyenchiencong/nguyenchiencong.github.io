28 december 2024,



We've welcomed a new member to our home in November 2024: Mangostine (Măng Cụt) - a ridgeback Phu Quoc dog. He's growing so fast.  

### Learning chinese

I really like the way the Chinese language works.
Each week, I try to learn a few words with [Hanzi.live](https://hanzi.live), a web app that I've built for my language learning process.  

It is intended to be used to access the knowledge tree of the language. I've condensed the grammar of the language into various types of sentences and words. It's in Vietnamese though. It will stay free and ad-free as long as it exists. Probably, I will open-source it someday.

I've translated the Tao Te Ching in both [Vietnamese](https://hanzi.live/practice/tao_te_ching) and [English](/dao). I'm quite happy with it.

### Making music

Since March 2024, I've had to temporarily halt the process of composing a piano concerto and a symphony. Instead, with Jane and Dawn, we've decided to make a RPG video game in 2D, and mostly because it's fun, and doing things together is even more fun. And, a game needs music too after all.

### Making a game

The name of the game is: The wise whispers of the trees - (樹木的智慧低語 in Chinese, and 樹木の智慧のささやき in Japanese).

And we are the - c本y crew - (pronounced K crew).

The word "cây" means "tree" or "[木](https://hanzi.live/hanzi/木)" in Chinese and pronounced like "K" in Vietnamese, while "[本](https://hanzi.live/hanzi/本)" means "root" and looks like "Â".

Our - c本y crew - office is set up; it is also our home, with around 100+ plants. Thanks to some friends, all our gears are set up: beefy pcs, drawing tablets, digital piano, etc.

We are building all the plans and stuff with Trello. I have a lot of fun coding with Gdscript, playing with Godot and implementing game design. [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai) has been a big help. 

F, a friend since childhood, joined the team at the beginning of December 2024. She worked as an architect until now; her latest project was a museum in Da Nang, which is to be opened soon. Now she will be drawing architectural designs, characters, and sceneries for the game.

Dawn is teaching herself Python with help from Claude and myself. Before she can jump into the project, she needs not only to be autodidactic but also to manage her time and energy more efficiently.

Jane is learning to draw pixel and to create character animations with Krita and Aseprite, and design other assets and architectural elements. 

Now, I'm working on the game's story, which is equivalent to writing a new book. We are drawing assets and characters for the first chapter of the game.  

I'm experimenting with local llms (large language models). I've played mostly with Ollama, Qwen2.5, Mistral and Gemma2, and Open WebUI as the interface. I've set up a few tuned llms for my process of writing the story for the game. It's quite cool to be able to run a large language model on your own machine, even without internet. Besides, I'm tweaking with the Latent Diffusion Model (Stable Diffusion, Flux) using the interface of ComfyUI, for image generation. Starting February 2025, things will move pretty fast with the help of our LLM and LDM AI-assistants, once they're fully set up for our workflows.

The game right now has a workable backbone: a turn-based combat system, menu system, bartering system, scene management, items, spells, skills, etc. The plot, mechanics, and characters are somewhat worked out. There will be 30+ chapters, each relating to an aspect of life.  

We are enjoying the process, and it's been a pleasure doing things together. Even the potential financial return doesn't seem to really matter at this point, though I'm certain it will be a success when the game will be out. Our aim is to make the best RPG [game](/game), which is also the best philosophical book, meaning it has to be beautiful, engaging and educational. And this kind of education is not based on discipline, meaning people are not made to conform.  

Anyway, we are sharpening every little detail by the day.
