### Learning chinese

I really like the way the Chinese language works.
Each day I learn a few words with [Hanzi.live](https://hanzi.live), a web app deployed that I've built for my language learning process.  

I will keep improving the current features without adding new ones from now on. It is intended to be used to access the knowledge tree of the language. I've condensed the grammar of the language into various types of sentences and words. It's in Vietnamese though. It will stay free and ad-free as long as it exists. Probably, I will open-source it someday.

I've finished translating the Tao Te Ching in both [Vietnamese](https://hanzi.live/practice/tao_te_ching) and [English](/dao).

### Making music

I have to make a temporary halt to the process of composing a piano concerto and a symphony. Instead, with Jane and Pink Dawn, we've decided to make a RPG game in 2D with Godot to earn a living income, and mostly because it’s fun, and doing things together is even more fun. And, a game needs music too after all. I've given my digital piano to a friend a few months ago, and now we're saving up for another one. So, once purchased, alongside playing for fun, I'll be making game music and maybe composing a piano sonata.

### Making a game

The name of the game is: Wisdom of the Trees - (樹木的智慧 in Chinese, and 樹木の智慧 in Japanese).

And we are the - c本y crew - (pronounced K crew).

The word "cây" means "tree" or "[木](https://hanzi.live/hanzi/木)" in Chinese and pronounced like "K" in Vietnamese, while "[本](https://hanzi.live/hanzi/本)" means "root" and looks like "Â".

Don’t know exactly how yet, but we plan to make a Kickstarter campaign to gather the funds beginning of 2025 to be able to do the work sustainably.
We are building all the plans and stuff with Trello. I had a lot of fun coding with Gdscript, playing with Godot and implementing game design.

We are setting up our - c本y crew - office, which is also our home for now, with around 100+ plants/trees.
Now, we need to buy a few PCs and some tablets for drawing.
We'll upgrade everything progressively and just powerful enough so we can run StableDiffusion.

Pink Dawn is leaning to code in Python with Claude. She'll be able to help me with the coding.

The game right now has a workable skeleton: a turn-based combat system, menu systems, scene managements, etc.
The plot, mechanics and characters are somewhat worked out. There will be 30+ chapters. Each relating to an aspect of life.
We are sharpening every little detail by the day.
