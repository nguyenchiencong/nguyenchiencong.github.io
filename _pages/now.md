### Making a video game

Mr. T just recently joined the crew.  

Details on the game [here](/game).  

Everything is on its course.  

Things are moving at an incredible pace.  

I’ve recently implemented a quasi-autonomous process for programming with Godot.
I’ve made it available here if you’re interested:  
- [godot-mcp](https://github.com/nguyenchiencong/godot-mcp)
- [godot-lsp-bridge](https://github.com/nguyenchiencong/godot-lsp-bridge)

Handling AI models and coding agents feels like collecting and handling pokemons.  

Health is fine again. We just had long covid.

I will update if there's something relevant to share.
