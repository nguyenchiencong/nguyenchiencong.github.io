### Learning chinese

I really like the way the Chinese language works.
Each week, I try to learn a few words with [Hanzi.live](https://hanzi.live), a web app that I've built for my language learning process.  

It is intended to be used to access the knowledge tree of the language. I've condensed the grammar of the language into various types of sentences and words. It's in Vietnamese though. It will stay free and ad-free as long as it exists. Probably, I will open-source it someday.

I've translated the Tao Te Ching in both [Vietnamese](https://hanzi.live/practice/tao_te_ching) and [English](/dao). I'm quite happy with it.

### Making music

Since March 2024, I've had to temporarily halt the process of composing a piano concerto and a symphony. Instead, with Jane and Dawn, we've decided to make a RPG video game in 2D, and mostly because it's fun, and doing things together is even more fun. And, a game needs music too after all.

### Making a video game

Things are moving quite fast, from story writing to architectural design to pixel art drawing to programming.
