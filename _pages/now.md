### Learning chinese

I really like the way the Chinese language works.
Each day I learn a few words with [Hanzi.live](https://hanzi.live), a web app that I've built for my language learning process.  

I will keep improving the current features without adding new ones from now on. It is intended to be used to access the knowledge tree of the language. I've condensed the grammar of the language into various types of sentences and words. It's in Vietnamese though. It will stay free and ad-free as long as it exists. Probably, I will open-source it someday.

I've translated the Tao Te Ching in both [Vietnamese](https://hanzi.live/practice/tao_te_ching) and [English](/dao). I'm quite happy with it.

### Making music

I have to make a temporary halt to the process of composing a piano concerto and a symphony. Instead, with Jane and Pink Dawn, we've decided to make a RPG game in 2D with Godot to earn a living income for the long term, and mostly because it’s fun, and doing things together is even more fun. And, a game needs music too after all. I've given my digital piano to a friend a few months ago, and now we're saving up for another one. So, once purchased, alongside playing for fun, I'll be making game music and maybe composing a piano sonata.

### Making a game

The name of the game is: Wisdom of the Trees - (樹木的智慧 in Chinese, and 樹木の智慧 in Japanese).

And we are the - c本y crew - (pronounced K crew).

The word "cây" means "tree" or "[木](https://hanzi.live/hanzi/木)" in Chinese and pronounced like "K" in Vietnamese, while "[本](https://hanzi.live/hanzi/本)" means "root" and looks like "Â".

Our - c本y crew - office is set up; it is also our home, with around 100+ plants/trees.

We are building all the plans and stuff with Trello. I have a lot of fun coding with Gdscript, playing with Godot and implementing game design. [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai) has been a big help.

Pink Dawn is learning to code in Python with Claude. She'll be able to help me with the coding in no time.

Jane will is learning to draw in pixel art and make character animation with Aseprite, and also other assets and architectural design.

The game right now has a workable backbone: a turn-based combat system, menu system, bartering system, scene management, items, spells, skills, etc. The plot, mechanics, and characters are somewhat worked out. There will be 30+ chapters, each relating to an aspect of life.  

We are enjoying the process so much, and it's been a pleasure doing things together. I have a bit of trouble sleeping lately, but it'll be okay soon. Even the potential financial return doesn't seem to really matter, though we are pretty sure it will be a success when the game will be out. Our aim is to make the best RPG [game](/game), which is also the best philosophical book, meaning it has to be educational. And this kind of education is not based on discipline, meaning people are not made to conform.  

Anyway, we are sharpening every little detail by the day.
