### Making a video game

Mr. T joined the crew recently.  

Details on the game [here](/game).  

Everything is on its course.  

Things are moving at an incredible pace.  

I’ve recently implemented a quasi-autonomous process for programming with Godot.
I’ve made it available here if you’re interested:  
- [godot-mcp](https://github.com/nguyenchiencong/godot-mcp-cli)
- [godot-lsp-bridge](https://github.com/nguyenchiencong/godot-lsp-bridge)
- [local-docs-mcp](https://github.com/nguyenchiencong/local-docs-mcp)

Health is fine again.  

I will update if there's something relevant to share.
