### Making a video game

Details on the game [here](/game).  

Everything is on its course. Houses, trees, roads, people got drawn, and new chapters will be written.

Things are moving quite fast, from story writing to architectural design to pixel art drawing to programming.  
Health is all good.  

I will update if there's something relevant to share.
