Duodenal ulcers caused by a bacteria called Helicobacter Pylori. Antibiotics, while trying to destroy all bacteria, can mess up your gut microbiome, make you weak and build up antimicrobial resistance. On the note, there are alternative and/or complementary remedies to this, for example turmeric powder. A great deal of research has been made on that, you should check it out if you have stomach problems. I find it funny that modern medecine just systematically goes for the hardcore way.
