I think a game is a great way to write a book nowadays. For traditional books with words, I find that many people do not read past a few sentences because they are stuck filtering each sentence with their guards always up. Even if the answer might come a few sentences or paragraphs further, they will stop before reaching that part and judge right away due to their short attention spans. There's no flow, making it difficult to guide someone's thoughts with a book. People just want immediacy and a sense of decision-making to strengthen their feelings.

So a game is a much more engaging way to touch base with one's own consciousness. Video games might just be the best medium to carry out philosophical thoughts because rather than just reading a book, in a video game you get to live the thought experiments in an immersive environment as an engaged actor.

Fortunately, our time allows us to do so. I can't speak for the future, but in past centuries, people couldn't make books as video games. I can't say if this will radically change things. Let's see.

### Making a game: Wise whispers of the trees

Jane and I, along with Dawn, have decided to create an RPG game in 2D using Godot around May 2024. F joined the crew in December 2024.  

The name of the game is: **Wise Whispers of the Trees** - (**樹木的智慧低語** in Chinese, **樹木の知恵の低語** in Japanese, and **Lời xanh từ rễ sâu** in Vietnamese).

And we are the - c本y crew - (pronounced K crew).

The word "cây" means "tree" or "[木](https://hanzi.live/hanzi/木)" in Chinese and is pronounced like "K" in Vietnamese, while "[本](https://hanzi.live/hanzi/本)" means "root" and looks like "Â".

Our - c本y crew - office is also our home, with around 100+ plants. Thanks to some friends, all our gear is set up: beefy PCs, drawing tablets, digital piano, etc.

F, a friend since childhood, worked as an architect; her last project was a museum in Da Nang. Now she is drawing architectural designs for the game.  

T, a friend and colleague of F, decided to join the crew in November 2025. He's also worked as an architect, and is learning programming in Python and GDScript.

Dawn has taught herself Python, GDScript, Godot and shaders with help from a few AIs. Now, she's building a remunerated project to practice before she can jump in with the Wise Whispers of the Trees.  

Jane is drawing beautiful trees with Krita and Aseprite, and designing other assets.  

I've programmed most of the game's codebase and now am working on a mini card game inside our game. Also, I'm working on refining the assets for the first few chapters.  
I will resume writing the next few chapters beginning of 2026.  

We are moving at an incredible pace.  

The game right now has a workable backbone. The plot, mechanics, and characters are somewhat worked out. There will be 30+ chapters, each relating to an aspect of life.  

We are enjoying the process, and it's been a pleasure doing things together. Even the potential financial return doesn't seem to really matter at this point, though I'm certain it will be a success when the game is out. Our aim is to make the best RPG game, which is also the best philosophical book, meaning it has to be beautiful, engaging and educational. And this kind of education is not based on discipline, meaning people are not made to conform.

Anyway, we are sharpening every little detail by the day.
