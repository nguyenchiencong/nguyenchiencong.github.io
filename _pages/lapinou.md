### Plants nursery

Our plants nursery/shop Lapinou is now closed. The whole thing was fun. I've come to appreciate our friends, the trees (æœ¨) more.
We have moved our remaining plants to our new small flat. It's a noisy area, but it has a West-directed view, which is perfect for watching sunset every day. 
Our cat will still be able to use his indoor litter box and his two cardboard properties and our [dog](/files/painting_dog.jpg) will still have to bear the hostility of city dwellers.
