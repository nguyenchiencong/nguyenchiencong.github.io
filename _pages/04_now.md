12 april 2024,

I’m building a Rails dictionary-based learning app for the Chinese language because I like the way the Chinese language works,
only for my use locally for now.
The dictionary part is mostly finished. For the grammatical part, I’m still  taking time to learn all the corners of the grammar to be able to compact it.
It's in Vietnamese though. I’d like to publish it online for free but that would mean that I will have to sustain it financially.
I might open-source it someday.

We are in the process of closing down our plant shop and finding a new home to live in.
We've had some plans to move, but they failed. So now, we're staying in the same city for at least 6 more months.

I have to make a temporary halt to my process of making a piano concerto.
With Jane and Pink Dawn, we've decided to make an RPG game in 2D with Godot for our living, mostly because it’s fun too.
The name of the game will be - Wisdom of the Trees. And we are the - cÂy crew. The word "cây" means "tree" in Vietnamese.

Don’t know exactly how yet, but we plan to make a Kickstarter to gather the funds beginning of 2025 to be able to do the work sustainably.
We are building all the plans and stuff with Trello. I had a lot of fun coding with Gdscript.

We need to upgrade a few PCs and buy some tablets for drawing, kind of expensive after all.
Guess, we'll upgrade everything progressively and just powerful enough so we can run StableDiffusion.

Artificial Intelligence right now is kind of cool: it helps us code, draw, make voice-overs, and everything faster.
Knowledge is cheap nowadays, and AI is just an extension of mankind. It's funny to see the efficiency of something that knows all the stuff yet doesn't actually understand what the real thing behind the word is. Like a human after all. Who is more intelligent than whom?
