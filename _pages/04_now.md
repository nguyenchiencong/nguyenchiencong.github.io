24 april 2024,

For more than a week, I've been dealing with duodenal ulcers caused by a bacteria called Helicobacter Pylori. It's really tiring to take antibiotics, and for me especially Tetracycline; it just wears me down. Honestly, this is my first time on antibiotics and I don't like it at all. Antibiotics, while trying to destroy all bacteria, can mess up your gut microbiome and build up antimicrobial resistance. On the note, there are alternative and/or complementary remedies to this, and I've been taking turmeric powder with honey. A great deal of research has been made on that, you should check it out if you have stomach problems. I find it funny that modern medecine just systematically goes for the hardcore way.

I’m building a Rails dictionary-based learning app to study the Chinese language because I like the way it works,
only for my use for now, locally.
The [dictionary](/files/dictionary.png) part is mostly finished, it is used to access the knowledge tree of the language.
For the grammatical part, I’m still taking time to learn all the twists and turns of the grammar to be able to compact it.
It's in Vietnamese though. I’d like to publish it online for free but that would mean that I will have to somehow sustain it financially.
I will open-source it someday.

We are in the process of closing down our plants nursery/shop and finding a new home to live in. It was fun. I've come to appreciate our friends, the trees (木) more.
We've had some plans to move to a place near a lake and a small forest (林), but they fell through. So now, we're staying in the same city for at least 6 more months.
Our cat will still be able to use his indoor litter box and his two cardboard properties and our [dog](/files/painting_dog.jpg) will still have to bear the hostility of city dwellers.

I have to make a temporary halt to the process of composing a piano concerto and a symphony.
Instead, with Jane and Pink Dawn, we've decided to make a RPG game in 2D with Godot to earn a living income, and mostly because it’s fun, and doing things together is even more fun. And, a game needs music too after all.

The name of the game will be - Wisdom of the Trees - (智慧の林 in Japanese).

And we are the - c本y crew - (pronounced K crew).

The word "cây" means "tree" or "木" in Chinese and pronounced like "K" in Vietnamese, while "本" means "root" and looks like "Â".

Don’t know exactly how yet, but we plan to make a Kickstarter campaign to gather the funds beginning of 2025 to be able to do the work sustainably.
We are building all the plans and stuff with Trello. I had a lot of fun coding with Gdscript, playing with Godot and implementing game design.

We need to upgrade a few PCs and buy some tablets for drawing, kind of expensive after all.
Guess, we'll upgrade everything progressively and just powerful enough so we can run StableDiffusion.

Artificial Intelligence right now is kind of cool: it helps us code, draw, make voice-overs, and everything faster.
Knowledge is cheap nowadays, and AI is an extension of mankind. Funnily, it is something quite efficient, that which knows all the stuff yet so clueless about the thing behind the word, all the intricacies of life. Like man, as he is right now after all. Who is more intelligent than whom? That might be a silly question. Rather, shouldn't one ask what is intelligence first? In Chinese, intelligence means 慧, composed of 彗 (comet) and 心 (heart); it can be interpreted as light from the heart. And 智慧 (wisdom) literally means intelligence of the mind (active) or the intelligent mind (passive); it has the word 慧 in it. Shouldn't the heart and the mind be one?

So, if one sees intelligence as something from the heart, not just as an ability to use experience and knowledge efficiently, then Artificial Intelligence is still artificial, just a mere cultivated intelligence, with no passion, no love. It is a powerful tool though. And, in that same line of thought, as long as man doesn't radically change, society will not change, and AI will always be biased.

Fun right?
