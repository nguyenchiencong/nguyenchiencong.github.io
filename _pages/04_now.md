12 april 2024,

I’m building a Rails dictionary-based learning app for the Chinese language because I like the way the Chinese language works,
only for my use locally for now.
The dictionary part is mostly finished. For the grammatical part, I’m still taking time to learn all the corners of the grammar to be able to compact it.
It's in Vietnamese though. I’d like to publish it online for free but that would mean that I will have to sustain it financially.
I might open-source it someday.

We are in the process of closing down our plants nursery/shop and finding a new home to live in. It was fun. I've come to appreciate our friends, the trees more.
We've had some plans to move to a place near a lake and a small forest, but they fell through. So now, we're staying in the same city for at least 6 more months.
Our cat will still be able to use his indoor litterbox and his two cardboard properties and our [dog](/files/painting_dog.jpg) will still have to bear the hostility of city dwellers.

I have to make a temporary halt to the process of composing a piano concerto and a symphony.
Instead, with Jane and Pink Dawn, we've decided to make an RPG game in 2D with Godot to earn a living income, and mostly because it’s fun too.

The name of the game will be - Wisdom of the Trees. And we are the - c木y crew.
The words "cây" and "木" mean "tree" in Vietnamese and Chinese respectively.

Don’t know exactly how yet, but we plan to make a Kickstarter campaign to gather the funds beginning of 2025 to be able to do the work sustainably.
We are building all the plans and stuff with Trello. I had a lot of fun coding with Gdscript, playing with Godot and implementing game design.

We need to upgrade a few PCs and buy some tablets for drawing, kind of expensive after all.
Guess, we'll upgrade everything progressively and just powerful enough so we can run StableDiffusion.

Artificial Intelligence right now is kind of cool: it helps us code, draw, make voice-overs, and everything faster.
Knowledge is cheap nowadays, and AI is just an extension of mankind. It's funny, it is something quite efficient, that which knows all the stuff yet doesn't actually understand what the actual thing behind the word, all the intricacies of life. Like a human after all. Who is more intelligent than whom? That might be a silly question.
